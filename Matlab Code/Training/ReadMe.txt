Step 1: Open this folder in Matlab to train the network for speech separation.
Step 2: open the matlab file 'training_for_source_separation' 
Step 3: you must give your dataset of two speakers as a two different files for training.
Step 4: the Matlab code itself mixes the speech signals automatically.
Step 5: then you will see the training progress of your model.
Step 6: after training you will get see a variable in the workspace of matlab named 'CocktailPartyNet.mat'
Step 7: Save the variable as .mat file in the Estimation Folder

Note: Already the network is trained with the 2 available speeches. You can use that too.
in that case you need not run this training file explicitly.
