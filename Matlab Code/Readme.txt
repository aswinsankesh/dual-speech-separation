This Matlab code consists of two folders... Training and Estimation...
First run the Training code to train the neural network to distinguish your own voices.
Next run the Estimation code, where you give your own mixed signal, and the code separates your voice using regression in already pre-trained network.

For reference there are already given two speech signals for different speakers.
You can use that too. Already the network CocktailPartyNet.mat is trained with these 2 speech signals to separate them.
