Step 1: Create a binary Mask using the Matlab(follow procedures given in Readme inside Matlab code folder)
Step 2: you will get a variable named 'HardMaleMask' and 'HardFemaleMask' in the workspace. CHoose either one
Step 2:  Now run the 'matlab_to_c_initialization' file and give your mask (HardFemaleMask/HardMaleMask) name to that program.
Step 4: You can run this code to generate a .txt file consisting of binMask values initialized according to C.
Step 5: You should rename the .txt file to .h file so that the C program could easily load it. or else if you find it difficult to convert to .h format,
you can simply copy and paste the .txt contents in the main program of your ccs
Step 6: Load the binMask_hello.h to the CCS project folder using Add files by right clicking project.
Step 7: Now you are ready to do it in real-time in CCS... Follow further procedures given there in Readme of CCS code folder.




Note: there is a Matlab file named 'matlab_to_c_initialization', this is used for converting the binMask matrix generated by matlab,
to a 2d array compatible with C program.
